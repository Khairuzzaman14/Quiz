# Ultimate Football Quiz

This is a quiz that tests the footballing knowledge of the player.
The player will have to answer 30 questions, whhile having 10 seconds for each question.
Choosing the correct answer will reward the player with one point.
The player may choose to skip the question if he wants to.
At the end of the quiz, the player's score will be displayed.

The layout of the quiz is done mainly on a "card" in HTMl. As such all of the components of the quiz is on the card.

The styling of the quiz is done via CSS.

A script is used for the quiz's game logic. Functions for the timer, score, start button and next button was created in the script.

A major hurdle I enctountered was regarding the timer. The timer seemed to malfunction when the "next" button was pressed quickly.
However, I managed to solve the issue.
